# batch & prefetch

* batch() is used to group the elements of the dataset into batches. In machine learning, it is common to train models on batches of data rather than individual data points, as this can improve the efficiency of model training. By batching the data, the model can make more efficient use of the hardware, such as GPUs, which are designed to perform computations on large tensors.

 * prefetch() is used to overlap the data preprocessing and model execution, which can improve the training speed, by allowing the CPU to work on data preprocessing while the GPU is busy training the model. The buffer_size argument determines the number of elements to prefetch. When the model is training on a batch of data, the next batch can be preprocessed in parallel using the CPU, and then immediately fed into the model when it is ready. This can reduce the waiting time for the GPU and improve the overall efficiency of the training process.

For example, if we have a dataset with 1000 images and a batch size of 32, we can use the prefetch() method to prefetch the next batch of 32 images while the model is training on the current batch. The tf.data.AUTOTUNE argument can be used to automatically adjust the buffer size based on available system memory and other runtime factors.
